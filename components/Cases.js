          Supporting Prayon&apos;s staff in the digital transformation by
          drawing up an inventory of individual digital skills and by organizing
          training adapted to each one to reach the expected level. This

          DHL wants to improve employee experience in a hybrid working set up,
          working both onsite and at home. We have the experience of working
          fully onsite and fully remotely but we also need to understand which
          challenges the hybrid model might bring along and which solutions we
          can put in place to mitigate possible issues.
